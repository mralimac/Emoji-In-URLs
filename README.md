# Emoji-In-URLs
A quick guide on having Emojis in a URL

##Why bother with this?
Although this can be seen as a fairly useless or gimmicky feature to have, it may have some useful applications
For example, instead of http://example.com/christmas you could use a Christmas-related Emoji in the URL, this means a user has to write less and you get a shorter URL that would be easier to print in an advertising campaign

You should also consider how much of Internet Traffic is done on smartphones and other mobile devices. Most of which can support emojis natively, we reach a point where everyone has the ability and knowledge to use Emojis fairly soon
